# Quantum Audiovisualizer
This project was developed by Ranger Liu, Herson Guerrero Huh, and Nikita Shtarkman for submission to the [2022 Quantum Design Jam at IBM](http://innovationcenter.newschool.edu/about-the-quantum-design-jam/). It explores the sonification and visualization of quantum circuits and their structure, expected behavior, and measured behavior.
